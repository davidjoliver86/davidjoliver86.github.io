      <description>⚠️ This tutorial is a relic of its time period, back when the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to surge. While the information is still relevant and factual, this tool was designed with once-in-a-lifetime supply chain conditions in mind, and the end result may not be as useful today as it was back when this article was written.&#xA;Quick update - in the last approx. 24-hour period since I deployed my stock checker to check on GTX 3070 stock, I actually did get a few hits back.</description>

At the end of the last part, we mentioned that we need a stateful data store for our Lambda function, otherwise it would keep wanting to send alerts every minute that there&amp;rsquo;s no stock, and that&amp;rsquo;s not very useful.</description>
