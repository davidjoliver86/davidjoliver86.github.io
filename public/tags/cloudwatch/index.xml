      <description>⚠️ This tutorial is a relic of its time period, back when the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to surge. While the information is still relevant and factual, this tool was designed with once-in-a-lifetime supply chain conditions in mind, and the end result may not be as useful today as it was back when this article was written.&#xA;Alright.. the home stretch. At the end of the last part, we mentioned that we need a stateful data store for our Lambda function, otherwise it would keep wanting to send alerts every minute that there&amp;rsquo;s no stock, and that&amp;rsquo;s not very useful.</description>

While the information is still relevant and factual, this tool was designed with once-in-a-lifetime supply chain conditions in mind, and the end result may not be as useful today as it was back when this article was written.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ve got a working Lambda function now, so let&amp;rsquo;s start adding in the other pieces of the AWS puzzle to turn this into a lean, mean, automated stock-checking machine.</description>
