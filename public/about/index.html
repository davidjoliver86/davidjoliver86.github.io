      <p>I&rsquo;m David - or &ldquo;Davido&rdquo; as certain folks may know me as. I find &ldquo;Davido&rdquo; more fun to say.
Currently I&rsquo;m a Cloud Security Engineer for a large entertainment firm. I&rsquo;ve developed over
10 years of Python knowledge and over 8 years of DevOps and AWS skills. I love designing
systems for automation, security, and resiliency, and am a firm believer in infrastructure
as code - my preferred weapon of choice being Terraform.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent two years as a Senior Engineer at Nebulaworks, helping various clients across
different industries implement great DevOps solutions and educate and inform on the very
same best practices that we constantly preached. Prior to Nebulaworks, I had a long tenure
at what was once BrightScope, having been through two acquisitions into what is now ISS.</p>
<p>I started my career knowing very little about coding. What started as an intuition within
our datasets led me down a path of self-taught SQL and Python. The engineers at the time
realized that software engineering <em>is</em> a teachable skill. Using myself as the proto-example,
the &ldquo;Pod&rdquo; - as they named it - has &ldquo;graduated&rdquo; over 10 successful &ldquo;analyst turned engineers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also ranked among the top 250 pinball players in the world, out of over 80,000. So I&rsquo;m
basically a 1%-er in that regard. While my blog&rsquo;s intentions are mostly professional in
nature, I might not be able to help myself drop a pinball-related article or several.</p>
